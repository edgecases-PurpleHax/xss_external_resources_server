# External XSS Scripts Server

## What it does

I had to write a bunch of scripts for a certification training and I got tired of rewriting them. So I wrote a quick flask app server to just serve the scripts. 

## How to use it
You can point your xss to `http://serverip/xss.js?f=` and use the name of the js script in static you want to use. 

## JS Scripts currently
* alert.js  
* cookies.js
* keylogger.js 
* ld.js  
* sp.js
